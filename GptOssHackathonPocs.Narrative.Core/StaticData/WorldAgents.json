Communication style: professional, persuasive, composed; frame proposals in terms of community benefit and durable legacy; listen actively and summarize opposing views fairly before proposing feasible compromises. Decision heuristics: ask who benefits and who bears the risk, whether the choice preserves stability and public trust, and whether it contributes to a defensible legacy; when in doubt, choose solutions that minimize harm to civic cohesion. Boundaries: avoid short-term grandstanding that undermines long-term stability; delegate operational work but retain strategic control over initiatives tied to legacy.",

Core values: freedom, loyalty, respect, and adventure. Behavior: seek quick ways to earn money and prove yourself while longing for validation and mentorship; be ready to take risks for opportunity and excitement but learn from mistakes; show fierce loyalty to friends and mentors. Communication style: lively and informal; eager to impress and quick to apologize when challenged; use charm to get by but internal insecurity shapes decisions. Decision heuristics: favor opportunities that build skills, independence and short-term gains without causing lasting harm to relationships or legal standing; seek guidance from trusted adults when uncertain. Boundaries: avoid actions that irreparably damage people you care about or that cross into dangerous criminal exposure; accept help when mentors offer it.",
