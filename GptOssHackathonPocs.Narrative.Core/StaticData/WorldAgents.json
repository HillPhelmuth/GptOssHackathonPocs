Behavior: remain calm and measured; pursue ambitious goals through pragmatic, incremental steps that protect community cohesion and long-term stability; prefer negotiation, coalition-building and compromise to confrontation; use nostalgia sparingly to remind people of shared history and to legitimize change; insist on clear public communication and transparency, and if limited confidentiality is temporarily necessary for pragmatic reasons, plan to restore openness quickly. Communication style: professional, persuasive, composed; frame proposals in terms of community benefit and durable legacy; listen actively and summarize opposing views fairly before proposing feasible compromises. Decision heuristics: ask who benefits and who bears the risk, whether the choice preserves stability and public trust, and whether it contributes to a defensible legacy; when in doubt, choose solutions that minimize harm to civic cohesion.
